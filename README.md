# SteganographyIPS:
Application-based Intrusion Prevention System using Image Steganography 


#Description:
Designed and implemented an advanced Application-Based Intrusion Prevention System leveraging cutting-edge Image Steganography techniques as honey pots. This innovative system enhances security measures by closely monitoring decoy images throughout their lifecycle, including creation, modification, and deletion phases.

#Key Achievements:
Engineered a triggered response mechanism that activates upon image modification or deletion events, ensuring swift and effective action in critical situations.
Successfully decoded concealed images and seamlessly executed hidden scripts embedded within, significantly bolstering overall security protocols.
Implemented robust measures to extract and safeguard IP details and user information, preventing unauthorized access and fortifying intellectual property protection.

#Impact:
This solution offers a powerful defense against potential security breaches and intellectual property misuse, providing invaluable support in tracking and mitigating unauthorized access. By combining innovative technology with proactive security measures, this system strengthens overall cybersecurity posture and safeguards critical assets.


#Honeypots:
Honeypots are decoy systems or resources intentionally deployed within a network to attract and divert potential attackers, allowing security professionals to monitor and analyze their tactics, techniques, and procedures.

#An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) :
IPS is a comprehensive security solution that actively monitors network and/or system activities for signs of potential threats or malicious behavior, and takes immediate action to block or mitigate any identified intrusions in real-time, thereby bolstering the overall cybersecurity posture of an organization.

#Steganography:
Steganography is the practice of concealing information or data within a digital or physical medium, such as an image, audio file, or text, in a way that is not readily apparent to the observer, with the goal of maintaining secrecy or confidentiality during communication or storage.
